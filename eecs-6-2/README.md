# Overview

Open source plan for following the MIT Electrical Engineering and Computer Science curriculum 6-2 Electrical Engineering and Computer Science as closely as possible using MIT OCW and freely available resources. For self learners that are interested in what it could be like to attend MIT, but were unable to attend due to its the extremely selective nature.

There are multiple majors within the EECS department that also include majors more focused on theoretical computer science, or biological systems. This program outline is for 6-2. Feel free to add submodules for the other majors.

**Curriculum overviews:** <https://www.eecs.mit.edu/academics/undergraduate-programs/curriculum/>

**Course load:** The average MIT student takes 4 courses per semester, 5 is possible but not recommended.

# Core Classes - 2022 requirements

## Year Zero

Year zero classes are the classes that would usually be completed during high school, the rest are completed at MIT. There is a graduation requirement at MIT that includes the courses below. These must be completed to receive your diploma.
| General Institute Requirements (GIRs)|
| --- |
|⚠️**DO NOT SKIP THESE COURSES IF**⚠️
| If you have not taken these classes before or do not feel like you have a solid understanding of the subjects, start at the beginning and work your way up. These are critical to for understanding the fundamental concepts and fully grasping the ideas discusses in the more advanced year courses. You will quickly lose motivation if you can't comprehend the subject matter. These courses are not "easy" and depending on your existing knowledge, you may need to go back to the very beginning in fundamental algebra, biology, and physics. |
