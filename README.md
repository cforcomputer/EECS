# Overview

Open source plan for following my custom MIT science curriculum using MIT OCW and freely available resources. This curriculum aims to provide a strong fundamental understanding in physics (with a focus in quantum physics), computer science, and electrical engineering. At the end of this course, students will be capable of engineering and building any project from theory to completion.

It is expected that as you progress in the course, you will focus more on a specific area.
